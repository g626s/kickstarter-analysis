# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist our client Louise who is an up-and-coming playwright. Louise’s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Our client wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever". We impleneted data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover and highlight any hidden trends. Excel was used to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successuful and by using Excel to analyze current site data, our analysis will help our client gain a greater understanding of campaigns, and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The first initial step of this analysis was to take an initial look and deep-dive at the kickstarter data. The goal of this step was to essentially size up the data, familiarize ourselves with it, and get a sense of what we are working with. In order to give Louise a better refined visual representation of the data we used conditional formatting in the 'Kickstarter' sheet to highlight the Campaign's Outcomes (column F). There are four main categories in the Outcome Column-Successful (Green), Failed (Red), Canceled (Yellow), and Live (Blue) to which we color code by category. In addition, for the Percentage Funded column (column O), we used value shading to apply a range of colors, based on the percentage funded which resulted in a color graded reference (red being the minimum and blue being the maximum). We further provided additional visualization of the data so that Louise can see the outcomes of the data and in the Theater category and broke it down even further by splitting the Category and Subcategory column (column N) into two distinct columns: "Parent category" and "Subcategory." We then created two pivot tables and pivot charts to share our findings to Louise in which the parent category "Theatre" and sub category "Plays" were at a 57.5% and 65.1% success rate and from compared to all values is the most successful:

Another valuable piece of data from this project is the length of the kickstarter fundraising campaigns. We then asked ourselves is the length of a campaign correlated with its success? In order to aid the fundrising campaign timeline for "Fever", we took a closer look at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome. In order to do this, we needed to convert the Unix timestamps in the Deadline and Launched_at columns to a more readable format which was a challenge and common issue in data analytics that we encountered in the project. Unix timestamps, which measure time as the number of seconds since midnight of January 1, 1970. While interesting, these timestamps are not exactly something we can use easily to give insights to our client In Excel we converted these timestamps into a day-month-year format that we can interpret. In the Date Created Conversion column (column S) and Date Ended Conversion column (column T) we entered the following formulas: 

=(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)

=(((I2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)

From the new Date Created and Date Ended Conversion columns we then created a new pivot chart and formatted it as a line chart to help determine calendar trends. From the analysis of the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Line charts May and June both have a greater success while also keeping in mind that January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

We then added statistical components that provided unbiased view of the data and make sound conclusions based on the calculations. Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of spread was used with the Crowdfunding data and we created a new sheet called "Descriptive Statistics". This will easily compare the goals and pledges for failed and successfull "US" campaigns alike and by comparing them, we'll be able to determine whether there were any trends between the goals and pledges in successful or failed campaigns. This table determined that for one, failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset. The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center and some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. From the data there must be some failed Kickstarter campaigns with very high goals:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, we first created a new column labeled "Years" and used the Year() function to extract the year from the “Date Created Conversion” column. We then created a pivot table from the KickStarter worksheet, and placed the pivot table in a new sheet called "Theatre Outcomes based on Launch date". On the pivot table we filtered "Parent Category" and "Years". For the column labels, we filtered to show only "successful," "failed," and "canceled." Lastly we filtered the "Parent Category" to show only the data for "theater", sorted the campaign outcomes in descending order so "successful" is first, and created a line chart from the pivot table to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, in the Kickstart sheet we created a new sheet and labeled it "Outcomes Based on Goals". In the new sheet we created the following columns to hold the data: Goal, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled. In the goal column, we created the following dollar-amount ranges so projects can be grouped based on their goal amount:

We then used the COUNTIFS() functions to populate the "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns by filtering on the Kickstarter "outcome" column, on the "goal" amount column using the give dollar-amount ranges, and on the "Subcategory" column using "plays" as the criteria. Then we used the SUM() function to populate the "Total Projects" column with the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row in the sheet. Lastly, we calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row in the sheet and create a line chart titled "Outcomes Based on Goal" to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenge and difficulties that were encountered in this project was formatting the Outcomes Based on Goals chart correctly for Louise as well as effectively apply the goal-amount ranges to help visualize the data. Orginally the outcomes based on Goals chart only displayed Percentage successful and in order to correct that mistake we had to swap the percentage cancelled and percentage failed column to correct this mistake. A lot of chart editing and formatting requires a lot of trial and error as well as expermientation to structure the data to obtain the desriable visualization.

## Results
From analyzing the Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date chart, we concluded that throughout the calendar year, certain months that contain holidays contribute to a significant spike of the success rate as well as the failure rate in which both lines follow a similar trend . In the chart for the months of February and October that saw a 71% and 61% success rate, there was a significant increase due to Febuary being correlated to Valentine's Day and October for Halloween. Another conclusion we based on the chart was that certain seasons throughout the real play a signficant role in the popularity and success rate in the case that we see in May that is the end of Spring and the start to Summer with a 111% success rate with a steep decline up until September. One conclusion that was made about the Outcomes based on Goals chart was that were a strong correlation between percentage successful and percentage failed as the goal ranged increased and were equal in terms of displaying the trends. Some limitations of the the kickstart dataset which is another important factor to consider for Louise is age demographics of patrons that see plays. This information could further give us and Louise insight on which genres of plays as well as content that contribute to successfull campaigns in the future. Another limitation of the kickstarter data is the data and information regarding the playwrights of the plays that could give some insight into successful works that are deemed successful. From the project, two additional graphs that we could have created were histogram and box and whiskers plot for Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals that can be used to illustrate the major features of the data's distribution to paint a clearer picture on certain outliers that may have effected the data or have skewed the information.
